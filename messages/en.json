        "vehicle": "Truck types",
        "vehicle_descr": "Most work is done by tautliner(curtainsider) and refrigerator with various variations. Additionally, we have a good park of Mega-trailer and Jumbo which helps us cover all our orders. Let us have a look for each type closer. \n \n 1. Tautliner(curtainsider). These are similar to the Euroliners, with sliding roofs, sliding curtains, and solid rear doors, some of them have side gates or sideboards, another not. The Tautliner has all-around flexibility for loading and unloading from the rear, sides and overhead. Maximum payload is varied from 22 tonnes to 25 tonnes. The useful area accommodates 33 pallets. \n 2. A refrigerator truck is a larger type of enclosed truck that is also designed for transporting temperature-sensitive cargo. It is typically used for longer-distance transportation and can be used for both fresh and frozen goods. It can typically carry a payload of up to 22,000 kilograms, and from 33 to 66 pallets. \n 3. Mega-trailer - it is the Tautliner (curtainsider) with the biggest capability because of the greater height (up to 3 meters). \n 4. The term jumbo refers to a special large type of truck. The jumbo trucks, unlike regular trucks, offer a much larger load volume. Therefore, the jumbo trucks naturally transport goods that occupy a great deal of volume and are also frequently used in the automotive industry due to the loading height of 3 meters. 38 pallets can be loaded on such truck.",

        "generalDescription": "The growing trend of sea transport has been constant and ever-increasing. Above all, from the early 1990s to the present day, maritime transport has become one of the main basic players in the transport of goods. \n The data show a truly enlightening reality: according to the latest studies and calculations, it is estimated that most goods, around 80%, are transported by sea. \n This is not a coincidence, the majority use of maritime transport is due to a series of qualities and characteristics that bring many benefits to companies. \n Our main activity is container shipping. The usage of containers provides added safety for transported goods. \n Taking into account individual customer requirements, our experienced staff offers optimal container freight transportation routes at competitive prices.

The 20’ standard container is also known as 20-foot dry container, 20-ft dry van container and 20’ft general purpose container. Commonly referred to as 20’DV, 22’GP, 22’G0 or 22’G1\n\n 40' Dry container\nInternal Dimensions: length: 12,03m; width: 2,35m; height: 2,39m\n Door Opening: width: 2,34m; height: 2,28m; \n Maximum payload Weight: 26’700kg to 28’200kg\nCapacity: 67,7m3.\nIts base allows up to 25 stacks of Euro pallets to be transported. The standard 40-foot container is also known as a 40’ dry container, 40’ dry van container or 40’ general purpose container. The market is increasingly asking for 40’High cube containers due to the extra cargo that can fit inside so the 40’ dry container is slowly being totally replaced by 40’High cube containers.

Commonly referred to as 45’HC or L5’G1.\n\nReefer (refrigerated) containers\nReefer containers (20’ and 40’) are used to transport chilled or frozen products. Fresh food is not permitted to be shipped unless it is in a refrigerated container.\nThese containers are used to transport fresh and frozen food, such as fish, meat, and fruit as well as other perishable cargoes. They are also commonly used in the transport pharmaceutical products.\nYou need to clearly indicate to us the temperature (in C°) at which the goods need to be carried before loading the goods in a reefer container.\nThe refrigerated container has a system that maintains a temperature inside the container of between -25 C° and +25 C°.\nContrary to widespread belief, these containers cannot cool the temperature because they do not generate cold air but can only maintain it.\nAlthough this type of container has an integrated motor that enables temperature cooling, the system must be connected to the power grid of vessels, to reefer plug infrastructure in the ports, or to a genset on trucks for inland transport.\nSome special types of refrigerated containers can maintain temperatures as low as -60° (deep frozen reefer containers).\n\n20’ Reefer container\nInternal Dimensions: length: 5,45m; width: 2,29m; height: 2,16m\nDoor Opening: width: 2,29m; height: 2,26m.\nMaximum payload Weight: 27’500kg.\nCapacity: 28,3m3.\nCommonly referred to as 20’RF, 20’RE or 22’R1.
